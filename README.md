# sh0rt
A small and simple URL shortener for an interview take home test. It stores the shortened links in a localStorage database structure, and the ID's are 2 words + a number, so it's easy to memorize too.

# Info
- React + Mantine, first try at the latter, contains many many essential hooks + a really nice customisable easy to learn UI too. 9/10
- For the "database-like" structure, I used a reactive way to store the items in localstorage, works fine.
- Some cleanup still needed I, missing error handling etc. would've implemented a generic error screen
- I don't really like the way I implemented the forwarding to the spec. URL's, there could be better ways ofc.
All in all, tried to make it in this 4-6h time I took on it as minimal but functional and not ugly as I could, first used an SCSS solution for everything but then just moved to have the Mantine theme styling createStyles way.

I hope it is sufficient for this time range!
